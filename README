sosreport is a tool used by many companies to gather the current state of a system into a portable archive primarily for use in troubleshooting. Eucalyptus Customer Success members identified the potentials of sosreport and created a package with plugins that target Eucalyptus support needs. Everything is written in Python and is easy to modify to our needs.

eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins contains plugins for sosreport that focus on the collection needs of Eucalyptus Clouds. Once these plugins have been added to a system with sosreport when run sosreport will pick up and execute them if applicable and place the output into the archive.

These plugins focus on these areas:

Console - if the Eucalyptus Console is installed.
Cluster - Information specific to the Cluster Controller
Core - Logs and commands that exist on all eucalpyus installs.
DB - Output from the database.
Frontend - Executed on the frontend using the installed euca2ools and eucalyptus-admin-tools
Node - Information from the Node Controller
