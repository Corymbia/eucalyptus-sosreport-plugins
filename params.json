{"name":"Eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins","tagline":"Custom sosreport plugins for working with Eucalyptus Clouds","body":"# Eucalyptus Plugins for Sosreport\r\n\r\n## Overview:\r\n[sosreport](https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport \"sosreport/sosreport\") is a tool used by many companies to gather the current state of a system into a portable archive primarily for use in troubleshooting. Eucalyptus Customer Success members identified the potentials of sosreport and created a package with plugins that target Eucalyptus support needs. Everything is written in Python and is easy to modify to our needs.\r\n\r\nThis project contains plugins for sosreport that focus on the collection needs of Eucalyptus Clouds. Once these plugins have been added to a system with sosreport when run sosreport will pick up and execute them if applicable and place the output into the archive.\r\n\r\nThese plugins focus on these areas:\r\n* Console - if the Eucalyptus Console is installed.\r\n* Core - Logs and commands that exist on all eucalpyus installs.\r\n* DB - Output from the database.\r\n* Frontend - Executed on the frontend using the installed euca2ools and eucalyptus-admin-tools\r\n\r\n## History:\r\neucalyptus-sosreport-plugins was formally a part of [doctor-euca](https://github.com/eucalyptus/doctor-euca \"eucalyptus/doctor-euca\").\r\n\r\nYou will want to make sure that when you execute sosreport that you have already sourced your eucarc file to get all of the correct output.\r\n\r\nThe original work for the project was done by [Tom Ellis](https://github.com/tomellis). The torch was picked up by [Richard Isaacson](https://github.com/risaacson) to drive and improve the project. Currently the project is being maintained by the Eucalyptus Tier 3 group, which is headed by [Harold Spencer, Jr.](https://github.com/hspencer77).\r\n\r\n## Targeted Systems:\r\nThe plugins package currently targets the version of sosreport that exists in the main CentOS 6.4 repository.\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\nIt is preferred to install eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins via the package but if not once sosreport is installed you are able to manually copy the files into the plugins directory.\r\n\r\n#### Package Installation:\r\n---------------------\r\nAdd the Eucalyptus Tools Repository.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncd /etc/yum.repos.d\r\nwget 'http://downloads.eucalyptus.com/software/tools/tools.repo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall the eucalyptus-sos-tools package which will install the sos package if it is not already installed.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nyum install eucalyptus-sos-plugins\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Manual Installation:\r\n--------------------\r\nTo install eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins manually you will need to have the following installed:\r\n\r\n* git\r\n* sosreport compatible with r2.2\r\n* python-devel\r\n* libxml2-python\r\n* yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins.git\r\ncd eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins\r\nmake rpm\r\nsudo yum install dist-build/noarch/eucalyptus-sos-plugins-<version>.el6.noarch.rpm\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Execution:\r\nExecution of sosreport is simple and straight forward. You will need to make sure that it is executed on each of the hosts that you want to collect data from. You will need to source your eucarc any time that you are executing sosreport with the eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins on a CLC host.\r\n\r\nAt the very least we want to make sure to use the `–batch` option so that interactive questions are no asked.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsosreport --batch\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecution could take severl moments. If it seems to be running long and it is not stuck on the databse the system plugin could be stuck. To skip the system plugin execute the following command.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsosreport --batch --skip-plugins=system\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter you have executed sosreport you should move the resulting archive out of /tmp as you risk imparing the system if /tmp is too full. If /tmp is limited you can create the archive in an alternate location by executing.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsosreport --batch --tmp-dir SOMEDIRECTORY\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Risks:\r\nSystems evolve and applications are upgraded. Going forward we need to make sure that we keep in sync with the version of sosreport that is in the mainline repositories. sosreport r2.3 has a lot of syntax changes from r2.2. When the main repos switch to sosreport r2.3+ we will need to rework our plugins to match the newer framework.\r\nCurrently sosreport's github is at version 3.0 of the software.\r\n\r\n## Versioning:\r\nr2.2 branch -> sosreport 2.2 (CentOS 6.4 uses this.)\r\n\r\nr2.3 branch -> sosreport 2.3 & 3.0(?) (This is the future.)\r\n\r\nmaster branch -> r2.2 branch\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting:\r\nYou are invited to point out any problems that might have happened while running the plugins. When submitting an issue please add the following so that we are able to best track down what the issue is.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know exactly what eucalyptus plugin failed please run the following and attach the output.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsosreport --batch --only-plugins eucacore,eucadb,eucafrontend,eucaconsole -vv\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you can identify a single plugin that is having problems run only that plugin and pull the output.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsosreport --batch --only-plugins PLUGIN -vv\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can also be helpful to avoid creating an archive. If you use the '–build' flag to leave the directory structure intact. sosreport will print a message about where the directory structure is located.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsosreport --batch --build\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Code Repositories:\r\nOfficial Repository: [eucalyptus/eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins](https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins)\r\n\r\nOriginal Repository: [risaacson/eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins](https://github.com/risaacson/eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins)\r\n\r\n## Issues/Improvement:\r\nWe are completely open and transparent with eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins as the source resides in a public repository on github. Any issues or requests for improvement should be placed on the github issues page: [eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins/issues](https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-sosreports/issues)\r\n\r\n#### Contributing Code:\r\n------------------\r\nFirst off, thank you.\r\nTo submit any code you will need to clone the repository through github. Make any changes to the appropriate branch. Currently you would switch to the b2.2 branch and make your changes. Complete your submission by creating a pull request.\r\nIt is polite to send [Harold Spencer, Jr.](https://github.com/hspencer77) a note as a heads-up when work is done.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
