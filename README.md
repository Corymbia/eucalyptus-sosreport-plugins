eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins
============================

eucalyptus-sosreport-plugins was formally a part of the doctor-euca project(https://github.com/eucalyptus/doctor-euca).

This project contains plugins for sosreport that focus on the collection needs of Eucalyptus Clouds.

These plugins are compatable with recent versions of sosreport. While attempts at getting it into the distribution repositories has stalled we will work towards hosting pre-built packages on the Eucalyptus download servers.

The original work for the project was done by Tom Ellis.
